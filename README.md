## Study Background
Siblings play important role in one another's development (Dunn, 1983; McHale, Updegraff, & Whiteman, 2012). Research on siblings has used global questionnaires and interviews to examine their relationships and interactions, mostly through *offline* activities. However, although social media has become an important part of many people's life, especially among youth and young adults (Pew Research Center, 2016), we know much less about how they interact *online*, including on social media (LeBouef & Dworkin, 2017). Twitter is a platform that people use for social networking and obtaining information (Zhao & Rosson, 2009). I use Twitter to examine sibling interactions online because it provides free, open source data through the API, and previous research has used data from Twitter to capture interactions between romantic partners (Garimella, Weber, & Cin, 2014).
